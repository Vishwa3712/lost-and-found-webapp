# 🛠️ Lost and Found Web App

Welcome to my **Lost and Found** web application! This is a personal full-stack project built with **React**, **Express.js**, **Node.js**, and **MongoDB**. The web app is designed to help students and individuals recover lost items efficiently by posting details and images of found objects, allowing claimants to submit proof of ownership. The admin oversees the verification process to ensure a smooth and secure experience.
